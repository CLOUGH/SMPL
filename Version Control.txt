V1 (what works, or what i have tried so far)

I have include our names in each file, if you create a new file, please do the same. This file will be used to state what works and what does not. Also, if you fix a feature, change the folder name to 
smplfinalv10, means version 1, increment 0
smplfinalv11, means version 1, increment 1
smplfinalv12, means version 1, increment 2
......
smplfinalv15, means version 1, increment 5

after 5 increments, increase the version number

smplfinalv20, means version 2, increment 0

test
